<h1>HTML Highlighting Made Easy</h1>
<p class="lead">

</p>

		<h4>Why does this exist?</h4>
		<p>
			Dealing with highlighting in browsers is diffucult. If you use the
			built-in browser highlight to mark parts of the page, you can only
			have 1 active highlight marked, and if the user clicks anywhere else
			on the page the highlight disappears. In addition, there's no way to
			add mouseover or other listeners to built-in browser. Furthermore,
			the interface for dealing with and manipulating selections is
			difficult to use.
		</p>
		<p>
			Saving and drawing highlights using HTML is definitely the way to go,
			but this, too, presents difficulties. HTML is a fundamentally a tree
			structure where each element has exactly 1 parent. However, selections
			break this structure because the user can select text which spans multiple
			HTML elements, and may even end in the middle of an element.
		</p>
		<h4>What does jQuery-Highlighter do?</h4>
		<p>
			jQuery-highlighter handles all the complexity of marking and drawing
			selections using HTML spans rather than the built-in highlighter. In
			addition, it simplifies the interface to read in selection bounds by
			returning a start index and end index of a selection relative to a
			parent HTML element as if there were only flat text inside, regardless
			of the complexity of the actual underlying HTML.
